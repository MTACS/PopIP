# PopIP
Display your device's IP address via an Activator gesture.

Another tweak I decided to open source for beginners/developers wanting to use IP related stuff.

## Code

This tweak was a bit more complicated to make, I not only had to write an Activator listener, but I had to grab the device's IP using another source. I am sure that I could've grabbed it via copying it from Settings, but I found an easier way.

To set it up, I used the Activator listener NIC template from [here.](https://github.com/theos/templates "Official Theos templates")
